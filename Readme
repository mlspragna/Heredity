# Heredity Inference

This repository contains code developed for the "Heredity" project as part of the "cs50's Introduction to AI" online course offered by Harvard University on edX.

## Overview

The Heredity Inference project focuses on predicting the probability distribution of individuals' genes and observable traits based on family relationships and known traits. It specifically deals with understanding how mutated versions of the GJB2 gene contribute to hearing impairment and how these traits are inherited within families.

## Folder Structure

1. **heredity**: Contains the main code file `heredity.py` and a data folder.
    - `heredity.py`: Python script for performing heredity inference.
    - `data`: Folder containing sample data files for testing the inference engine.

## Usage

The `heredity.py` script takes input data describing family relationships, gene information, and observed traits, and outputs the probability distributions for each individual's genes and trait expression.
