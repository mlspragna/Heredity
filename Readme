# Advanced Image Processing

This repository contains code and documentation developed as part of the coursework for CS 754 Advanced Image Processing at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB).

## Overview

The "Advanced Image Processing" repository consists of five assignments and a project focused on Estimation of Covariance Matrix. Each assignment folder contains code and documentation pertaining to specific topics covered in the course.

## Project: Estimation of Covariance Matrix

### Abstract

This project presents a method for estimating the sample covariance matrix from compressive measurements of low-dimensional random projections. The method offers an unbiased covariance matrix estimation using random projection matrices with certain distributional properties.

### Description

The project focuses on estimating the covariance matrix from low-dimensional projections of data. It introduces an unbiased estimator for the sample covariance matrix and discusses the use of sparse random projection matrices to reduce computational cost and bias terms.

### Experimental Results

Experimental results are provided for various real-world datasets, including MNIST, Gen4, and traffic datasets. The accuracy of the unbiased covariance estimator is evaluated using the normalized covariance estimation error, with graphs and images illustrating the accuracy of the estimated covariance matrices.
